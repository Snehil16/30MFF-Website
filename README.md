## Project Name: Route to Communication Lab

## Project Description

### This project deals with the route to communications lab. The website should be able to convey a feeling to the viewer that they are actually on the journey. The image of buildings at the start and at the end of the website along with a road image between it which provides a feeling of travel thtoughout the site. 

## Process

### The layout of the whole website has been implemented using 'flexbox'. I did some research on testimonial carousel, I took inspiration from works over the internet and implemented the something similar to it using HTML, CSS and JS.  

## Reflection/Evaluation

### The plan was to make something like this and I ended up doing the same. The only problem was that I was using the video tag not realising that video size is too large and could not be uploaded on github. However, I implemented something similar to it using iframe tag for youtube videos.
